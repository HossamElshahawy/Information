How are you sir üòÄ
Iam hossam elshahawy from egypt in faculty of computer and information department bioinformatics ..
I have start laravel from 1/12/2021 with IEEE organization (activity student) now we build site for branch Kafr elshikh but not launch till now ..
I didn't do any site or project but i have medium knowledge about laravel and good in search.
I learned form documents and done (the basics/database/eloquent ORM) but think not  very efficient .
I think for now i need do projects but need mentor or senior guide me to the process i should do .. 
Finally i need know what is your plan and what u suggest for me to do .. 
Thanks For your Time ‚ù§Ô∏è
